Summary: Performance Logger Rework

Description:
Redesigned Performance Logger. New goal is just to output points so that we can make an average score over time graph.
Removed finish method in performance logger.
removed print method in performance logger.
(basically stripped anything that does not pertain to the new goal.)

Changed add game in performance logger now takes the score of a game and its game number. adds up the scores to get a sum and then averages and prints to the file.
